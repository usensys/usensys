Drafting US energy system model using **R** (https://www.r-project.org/) and **energyRt** (https://github.com/olugovoy/energyRt).  
  
## Electric power sector  
This is the first sector in the pipeline.. There will be two main versions of the sector:  
* capacity expansion (with focus on long-term planning)  
* balancing version (with focus on sub-annual and balancing for demand and supply).  

*WORK IN PROGRESS*  
By now, here is the data webscraping/processing file `US_ELC_data.Rmd` and some visualisations of drafted scenarios with the balancing version of the model:
